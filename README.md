This is my entry for the 2024
"[RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/1dt8bqm/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/)"
event.

The goal is to recreate the classic Rogue game with modern technology,
following the steps outlined in the tutorial series.

This project is developed using Python 3.12 and the
[python-tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) library.

Thank you to the authors and contributors of these projects for their
invaluable work!

This project would not have been possible without the support of
the [python-tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) library. Special
thanks to the developers and community behind python-tcod for their
contributions and dedication.

A heartfelt shout-out to the original authors of the Rogue game. Neither this
project nor the larger roguelike scene would be possible without their
pioneering work and creativity.
