Thank you to the authors and contributors of these projects for their
invaluable work!

This project would not have been possible without the support of
the [python-tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) library. Special
thanks to the developers and community behind python-tcod for their
contributions and dedication.

A heartfelt shout-out to the original authors of the Rogue game. Neither this
project nor the larger roguelike scene would be possible without their
pioneering work and creativity.
